# PrepivotedPermutation

PrepivotedPermutation.R contains functions used to conduct the prepivoted permutation tests described in Sections 5.2-5.4 of the manuscript and A.1-A.2 of the Supplementary Material. 

The script PrepivotedPermutationScript.R illustrates how to use these functions with data simulated from the data generating mechanisms described in Sections 5.2-5.4 of the manuscript and A.1-A.2 of the Supplementary Material.
